Excersice 2:

The main difference between primitive data type int and class Integer
is that int is a data type of the Integer wrapper class. Therefore, int is
not as flexible because we can only store a binary value in it. On the other
hand, class Integer is more flexible because you can add methods to it and thus 
manipulate the int data type to any data type by casting it be any other data type
like float or double. The class Integer is of more advantage due to the fact that 
data can be manipulated while primitive data type int is useful when we want an 
integer to keep is data type and not change.

For primitive data type int, you can use:
BYTES
MAX_VALUE
MIN_VALUE
SIZE

Or class Integer, you can use:
TYPE
decode()
doubleValue()
getInteger()
valueOf()
bitCount()
compare()
compareUnsigned()
divideUnsigned()
hashcode()
highestOneBit()
intValue()
sum()
signum()
rotateRight()
rotateLeft()
reverseBytes()
reverse()
remainderUnsigned()
parseUnsignedInt()
parseInt()
numberOfTrailingZeros()
numberOfLeadingZeros()
min()
max()
lowestOneBite()
